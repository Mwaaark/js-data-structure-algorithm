HASH TABLES (HASH MAP)

  DEALING WITH COLLISIONS
    even with large array and a great hash
    function, collisions are inevitable
    
    There are many strategies for dealing
    with collisions, but we'll focus on two:

      - Separate Chaining
          each index in our array we store values
          using a more sophisticated data structure
          (e.g an array or a linked list)

      - Linear Probing
          when we find a collision, we search through
           the array to find the next empty slot
