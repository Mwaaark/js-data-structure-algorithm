INTERMEDIATE SORTING ALGORITHMS 

    FASTER SORTS
        - there is a family of sorting ALGORITHMS
          that can improve time complexity from
          O(n^2) to O(n log n)
        - there's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
        - the more efficient algorithms are much less simple,
          and generally take longer to understand
