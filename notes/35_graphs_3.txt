GRAPHS

    ADJACENCY MATRIX (STORING GRAPHS)
        In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency 
        matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite 
        graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether 
        pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. 
        In the special case of a finite simple graph, the 
        adjacency matrix is a-matrix with zeros on its diagonal

        For undirected graphs, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.

    ADJACENCY LIST (STORING GRAPHS)
        In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency list 
        is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a 
        finite graph. Each unordered list within an adjacency 
        list describes the set of neighbors of a particular 
        vertex in the graph.


    DIFFERENCE
        LIST
            - can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
              (Sparse graph - is a graph in which the number of 
              edges is much less than the possible number of 
              edges)
            - faster to iterate over all edges

            - can be slower to lookup specific edge

        MATRIX
            - takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
            - slower to iterate over all edges

            - faster to lookup specific edge
