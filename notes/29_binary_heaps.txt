HEAPS
  another type/category of trees

BINARY HEAPS
  very similar to a binary search tree, but
  with some different rules

  in a MaxBinary Heap, parent nodes are
  always larger than child nodes. In a
  MinBinary Heap, parent nodes are always
  smaller than child nodes

  WHY DO WE NEED TO KNOW THIS?
    Binary heaps are used to implement
    Priority Queues, which are very commonly
    used data structures

  INSERT
    - add to the end
    - bubble up

  REMOVE / extractMax
    - remove the root
    - replace with the most recently added
    - adjust (sink down)
