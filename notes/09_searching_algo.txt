SEARCHING ALGORITHM

  LINEAR SEARCH (arrays)

  BINARY SEARCH (sorted arrays)
    - is a much faster form of search
    - rather than eleminating one element at a time,
      you can eliminate half of the remaining elements
      at a time
    - binary search only works on sorted arrays

  NAIVE STRING SEARCHING ALGORITHM
    - a straightforward approach involves checking
      pairs of characters individually
