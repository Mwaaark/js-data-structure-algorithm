RECURSION

  WHERE THINGS GO WRONG
    - no base case
    - forgetting to return or returning the
      wrong thing
    - stack overflow

  HELPER METHOD RECURSION

    So helper method recursion is just a pattern 
    where we have an outer function that's not 
    recursive, which calls an inner function.
    Which is recursive.

  PURE RECURSION
    pure recursion, meaning the function itself is totally self contained and it's recursive.

    We don't have some external data structure like we had here.
