BUILT IN JS SORT

    sort()

    - built-in sort method accepts an optional
      comparator function
    - you can use this comparator function to tell
      JavaScript how you want it to sort
    - the comparator looks at apairs of elements
      (a and b), determines their sort order based
      on the return value
        
        - if it returns a negative number, a should
          come before b
        - if it returns a positive number, a should
          come after b
        - if it returns 0, a and b are the same as
          far as the sort is concerned
