LOGARITHMS

  We've encountered some of the most common
  complexities:
    O(1)
    O(n)
    O(n^2)

  Sometimes big O expressions involve more complex
  mathematical expressions

  One that appers more ofen than you might like is
  is the logarithm

  RULE OF THUMB
    the logarithm of a number roughly measures the
    number of times you can divded that number by 2
    before you get a value that's less than or equal
    to one
