  CLASS
    a blueprint for creating objects with
    pre-defined properties and methods

    classes are created with the new keyword


  CONSTRUCTOR
    the constructor function is a special function
    that gets run when the class is instantiated

    in objects


  CLASS METHOD
    class methods can be added using the static
    ketword

    STATIC
      - utility method
      - to call from class itself, not individual 
        instance

  THIS
    - inside all of our instance methods and
      constructor, the keyword 'this' refers
      to the object created from that class
      (also known as an instance)
