HASH TABLES (HASH MAP)
    are used to store key-value pairs

    they are like arrays, but the keys
    are not ordered

    unlike arrays, hash tables are fast
    for all of the following operations:
    finding values, adding new values,
    and removing values

    WHY SHOULD I CARE?
        nearly every programming language
        has some sort of hash table data
        structure

        Because of their speed, has tables
        are very commonly used

    HASH TABLES IN THE WILD
        - Pyhton has Dictionaries
        - JS has objects and maps
            * Objects have some restrictions,
              but are basically hash tables
        - Java, Go & Scala have maps
        - Ruby has hashes

    HASH FUNCTION

        WHAT MAKES A GOOD HASH?
        (not a cryptographically secure one)

        - fast (i.e. constant time)
        - doesn't cluster outputs at specific
          indices, but distributes uniformly
        - deterministic (same input yields
          same output)

        PRIME NUMBERS
            the prime number in the hash is
            helpful in spreading out the keys
            more uniformly

            it's also helpful if the array that
            you're putting values into has a
            prime length
