QUICK SORT
  - like merge sort, exploits the fact that
    arrays of 0 to 1 element are always sorted

  - works by selecting on element (called the
    "pivot") and finding the index where the
    pivot should end up in the sorted array

  - once the pivot is positioned appropriately,
    quick sort can be applied on either side
    of the pivot
