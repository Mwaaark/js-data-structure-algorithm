ANALYZING PERFORMANCE OF ARRAYS AND OBJECTS

  OBJECTS
    Unordered, key value pairs

    WHEN TO USE
      - when you don't need order
      - when you need fast access / insertion / removal

    BIG O OF OBJECTS
      Insertion - O(1)
      Removal - O(1)
      Searching - O(N)
      Access - O(1)

    BIG O OF OBJECT METHODS
      Object.keys = O(N)
      Object.values = O(N)
      Object.entries = O(N)
      hasOwnProperty = O(1)

    When you don't need any ordering, objects are
    an excellent choice

  ARRAYS
    Ordered lists

    WHEN TO USE
      - when you need order
      - when you need fast access / insertion and
        removal (sort of...)

    BIG O OF ARRAYS
      Insertion - it depends...
      Removal - it depends...
      Searching - O(N)
      Access - O(1)

    BIG O OF ARRAY OPERATIONS
      push - O(1)
      pop - O(1)
      shift - O(N)
      unshift - O(N)
      concat - O(N)
      slice - O(N)
      splice - O(N)
      sort - O(N * log N)
      forEach / map / filter / reduce / etc. - O(N)
      indexOf - O(N)
